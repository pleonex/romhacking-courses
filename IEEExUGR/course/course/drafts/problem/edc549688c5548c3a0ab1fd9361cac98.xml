<p>In a numerical input problem, learners enter numbers or a specific and
relatively simple mathematical expression. Learners enter the response in
plain text, and the system then converts the text to a symbolic expression
that learners can see below the response field.</p>

<p>The system can handle several types of characters, including basic
operators, fractions, exponents, and common constants such as i. You can 
refer learners to
